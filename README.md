# MSDS610_CLT
The slides introduce a few probability distributions with graphs, functions and examples and the Central Limit Theorem with its development.

The notebook attached demonstrates how the central limit theorem works using randomly generated data with different population distributions and also with a real-world weather data of over four years in China.

Directions for using the simulation:

Use the below intuitive and easy to adjust levers, to see the histogram get plotted for the sampling distribution as well as validate Central limit theorem

1. Population Distribution selection from drop down
2. Sample size and no of samples from sliders
3. No of bins in the output histogram from slider
